I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m one of those introverts or if I&rsquo;m just socially awkward, but the very idea of going around trying to converse with total strangers just to exchange business cards is not at all appealing to me. Anyway, that&rsquo;s another story. Right now I want to write about something a guy from a non-tech company asked&nbsp;me:</p> <blockquote> <p>- Have you built anything cool?<br> - [pause] Well, more or less&hellip;<br> - What do you mean by &ldquo;more or less&rdquo;? [&hellip;] Have you built anything at&nbsp;all? </p> </blockquote> <p>Then I went on trying to explain what my recent side project&ndash; <a href="https://pytaku-legacy.appspot.com">pytaku</a>&ndash;does and why it is awesome for me. He seemed to be disinterested halfway through so I decided to shut up&nbsp;anyway.</p> <p>Sure, I have done stuff now and then, be it assignment work or something I decided to create for my own amusement. It is just funny how I have already stepped into to my final year without taking a proper look back at what I have done in these past 2 years, so I&rsquo;m going to do just&nbsp;that.</p> <p>If you&ndash;Nicholas&ndash;are reading this and don&rsquo;t want all the nerdy stuff, here are my condensed&nbsp;answers:</p> <h3 id="have-you-built-anything">Have you built anything?<a class="headerlink" href="#have-you-built-anything" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3> <p>Yes, I have made desktop and Android games, a movie ticket sales program, a desktop manga grabber, a web version of it that talks to dropbox, and several small shell scripts / web&nbsp;utilities.</p> <h3 id="so-nothing-cool">So, nothing cool?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-nothing-cool" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3> <p>If you&rsquo;re neither a tech geek nor an otaku (which I assume you&rsquo;re not) then no, there&rsquo;s probably nothing I&rsquo;ve done that you would find&nbsp;interesting.</p> <h2 id="nerd-alert">Nerd alert!<a class="headerlink" href="#nerd-alert" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>The rest of this post is aimed at the <del>nerdier</del> more tech-savvy audience. You have been warned&nbsp;;)</p> <h2 id="first-year-welcome-to-the-web-and-the-gui-programming-disillusionment">First year&ndash;Welcome to the web, and the <span class="caps">GUI</span> programming disillusionment<a class="headerlink" href="#first-year-welcome-to-the-web-and-the-gui-programming-disillusionment" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>I had touched <em>web stuff</em> before in high school: a vBulletin forum that I created (unofficially) for students in my middle school. However, I only properly learned <span class="caps">PHP</span> and <span class="caps">JS</span> when I started the Web Programming course here. With (moderately) great power came great desires, so I set out to build a basic <span class="caps">PHP</span> site to scrape a youtube view page&rsquo;s <span class="caps">HTML</span> to get direct video links (not working anymore since a recent youtube&nbsp;update)</p> <p><img alt="tubegrab v2.9" src="/images/tubegrab.jpg" title="tubegrab v2.9"></p> <p>That was my first touch on jQueryUI and regular expressions; I also learned how <span class="caps">RMIT</span>&rsquo;s mekong server sucked to the point that it didn&rsquo;t allow <code>get_file_contents()</code>.</p> <p>About school assignments? Nothing interesting: standard minimal <span class="caps">LAMP</span> <span class="caps">CMS</span> with jQuery glitter sprinkled on top. Not a bad experience but&nbsp;meh.</p> <p>I also learned about <span class="caps">MVC</span> and <span class="caps">GUI</span> programming with Java swing. I did write a movie ticket program with a (pretty minimal) seat picker and <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/sealord">a battleship-inspired game</a>: </p> <p><img alt="Cinema Movie Picker" src="/images/cinema_1.png" title="Cinema Movie Picker"> <img alt="Seat Picker" src="/images/cinema_2.png" title="Seat Picker"> <img alt="Sealord" src="/images/sealord.png"></p> <p>Then it occurred to me that programming <span class="caps">GUI</span> interfaces for desktop programs was much more tedious than doing it for the web, especially when working with the now-not-favored Swing toolkit. Nightmarish&nbsp;days&hellip;</p> <p>Another lesson learned the hard way was that &ldquo;<span class="caps">MVC</span>&rdquo; is not even a concrete thing, and there is hardly any obvious &ldquo;one true way&rdquo; to implement that. I spent much more time planning for plumbing code than I the time I spent actually writing &ldquo;feature&rdquo; code. And the result, now looking back, was not even that good. And yeah, there was no such thing as &ldquo;separation of concerns&rdquo; in my code back then, which eventually led to countless times of tracing obscure stack traces for debugging (good thing I had a lot of free time back&nbsp;then).</p> <p>To rub salt in the wound, I came to realize that nobody cared how Swing looked on any desktop environment other than <span class="caps">OS</span> X and Windows. Font rendering was painful to look at, and the only way to make it <em>a little bit</em> more acceptable was using a <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/install-openjdk-patched-with-font-fixes.html">forked version of OpenJDK</a>. <span class="caps">WTF</span> guys? And that&rsquo;s not the only problem; let&rsquo;s talk Look And Feel. Java&rsquo;s built-in getSystemLookAndFeel() could only detect <span class="caps">GNOME</span>&rsquo;s. When developing <code>ajmg</code> I discovered that and had to write my own method that extended the thing to detect more DEs, but soon after that I thought &ldquo;What the hell, why do I even have to do this?&rdquo; and decided that Swing was dead to me (or any desktop Linux user for that&nbsp;matter).</p> <h2 id="second-year-enough-of-this-bull-school-crap-im-making-stuff-for-myself">Second year: enough of this <del>bull</del> school crap. I&rsquo;m making stuff for myself!<a class="headerlink" href="#second-year-enough-of-this-bull-school-crap-im-making-stuff-for-myself" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>To be fair, the following year has offered a number of new stuff: C/C++ programming, a taste of the M$ .<span class="caps">NET</span> C# stack (still impressed by Visual Studio&rsquo;s vi mode plugin), more Java, <a href="http://truongtx.me/2013/05/02/agent-069-game/">Android app programming</a>, and some neat security tricks. However, none of those intrigued me much, so I decided to start making things for my&nbsp;own:</p> <h3 id="shell-scripts">Shell scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#shell-scripts" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3> <p>If you have taken a look at my <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>, you&rsquo;ll notice that I do write a bunch of shell scripts to automate stuff I do often. The one I&rsquo;m currently proudest of is <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/rmitproxy_silent">rmiproxy_silent</a>, a script that automatically detects whether I am using <span class="caps">RMIT</span>&rsquo;s network and set/clear the appropriate proxy settings. Another one that I can&rsquo;t live without is <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh">install.sh</a>, a script that helps install all my dotfiles, sets up zsh and various things. It saved me <em>a lot</em> of time whenever I reinstall my&nbsp;system.</p> <p>Obligatory shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/">oh-my-zsh</a>, greatest invention since sliced bread! Those guys are&nbsp;awesome!</p> <h3 id="ajmg-then-pytaku-then-who-knows"><span class="caps">AJMG</span>, then Pytaku, then&hellip; who knows?<a class="headerlink" href="#ajmg-then-pytaku-then-who-knows" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3> <p>The original idea was actually creating a Java Swing program that helps download manga. It was born out of frustration of <a href="http://blog.domdomsoft.com/">DomDomSoft</a>, a manga downloader that requires &ldquo;donation&rdquo; to unlock full functionalities. &ldquo;I could do that, and I&rsquo;ll open source the crap out of it, because open source is awesome&rdquo;, I thought. Then I spent some time and got the minimal program working&nbsp;program:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/ajmg.png"></p> <p>This program did help me get a firm knowledge of java&rsquo;s thread manipulation and using http proxy (so I could exploit <span class="caps">RMIT</span>&rsquo;s awesome network bandwidth). I also succeeded in achieving separation of concern to a certain level this time, allowing contributors (if any) to easily add support for other manga reader sites. But then again, Swing&rsquo;s quirks put me off, so my bad habit of losing interest quickly kicked in and the project stopped&nbsp;there.</p> <p>Then came <a href="https://pytaku-legacy.appspot.com">Pytaku</a>, ajmg&rsquo;s spiritual successor. At this point I knew enough of python and wanted to try out Google App Engine, so I decided to make a web version of <span class="caps">AJMG</span>, with the difference that instead of downloading directly, it forwards everything to the user&rsquo;s Dropbox folder. Why not Google Drive you ask? Because they haven&rsquo;t even bothered to release an official Linux client for it. Shame on you,&nbsp;Google!</p> <p>Loads of exciting things were learned along the way: how <span class="caps">URL</span> handling works in webapp2 and in other web frameworks in general, proper templating (can&rsquo;t believe I ever wrote <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php echo $title; ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>&hellip; not cool!), OAuth2 (more than a few &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments working with this little guy&hellip;), Google&rsquo;s Datastore and NoSQL in general, and of course, Twitter Bootstrap&ndash;saving clueless non-designer developers since its&nbsp;inception.</p> <p>And now, I&rsquo;m rewriting it from scratch, this time trying out <span class="caps">TDD</span>, making use of <a href="https://travis-ci.org/nhanb/pytaku">travis-ci</a>, which will be especially helpful to periodically test if a manga site has changed its page layout and screwed up Pytaku&rsquo;s scraping code. I have encountered a number of quirks when trying to set up the correct testing boilerplate for a Google App Engine project, but it seems everything will be smooth from now on. This holiday season I plan to at least roll out an alpha version to show off. Stay tuned if you&rsquo;re&nbsp;interested!</p> <h2 id="to-sum-it-up">To sum it up&hellip;<a class="headerlink" href="#to-sum-it-up" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>I don&rsquo;t believe in developing products I myself don&rsquo;t want to use. I want to make things that make my life easier, and if that helps others too then it&rsquo;s a huge bonus. This is why Github is my favorite company right now, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyz3jkOBbQY">How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub</a> remains the best developer speech I have ever&nbsp;seen.</p> <p>Right now I haven&rsquo;t made a full-blown program that I can confidently distribute to end users, but I certainly have made quite a few nifty tools to improve my day-to-day computing tasks and learned a lot along the way. Right now I cannot confidently answer this big question by pointing them to a polished website detailing every nook and cranny of my shiny widely-used, battle-tested program, but I&rsquo;m confident I have the right knowledge to get there. If there is such a thing as &ldquo;Lunar New Year Resolution&rdquo;, I guess mine is that one year from now, I will have a satisfying answer to this question. Watch out world, I&rsquo;m&nbsp;coming!</p> <p>If you managed to get here, you are probably a tech geek like me.
