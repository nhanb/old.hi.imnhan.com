The following is the original&nbsp;article.</p> <hr> <p><strong><span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>:</strong> bright crisp screen, acceptable keyboard, thin <span class="amp">&amp;</span> light build, random touchpad lag on both ChromeOS and Linux, almost usable on MrChromebox <span class="caps">UEFI</span> + Arch Linux except for the fact that internal speakers crash most of the time (wired headphones work fine though). It&rsquo;s absolutely not worth the sticker price at <a href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-enterprise-spin-713-cp713-3w/pdp/NX.AHAAA.006">$1,099.99</a> (lol). Maybe consider buying if you can find it at a heavy discount and the speakers issue has been fixed&nbsp;somehow.</p> <h2 id="context">Context<a class="headerlink" href="#context" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>Around 2022 I was looking for a replacement for my T530&mdash;something lighter with a better screen&mdash;and saw a listing for a used Acer Chromebook Spin 713-3W at only 10mil <span class="caps">VND</span> ($425, give or take). A recently released HiDPI laptop with an i5-1135G7 at 425 freedom dollars? And I get to play with ChromeOS/Crostini on a not-pathetically-weak x86 device? Sign me right up, I thought. The plan was to run ChromeOS/Android apps for <span class="caps">GUI</span> stuff, and install my usual tmux+vim based development <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nhanb/neodots">environment</a> on&nbsp;Crostini.</p> <h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hardware" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <ul> <li>Specs: i5-1135G7 (Tiger Lake), Xe graphics, <span class="caps">8GB</span> <span class="caps">RAM</span>, <span class="caps">256GB</span> <span class="caps">SSD</span></li> <li>Keyboard:&nbsp;acceptable</li> <li>Screen: 2256x1504 (3:2) at 13.5&rdquo; (200dpi).

What you&rsquo;re referring to as Linux, is in fact, <span class="caps">CHROME</span>/Linux, or as I&rsquo;ve recently taken to calling it, <span class="caps">CHROME</span> plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning <span class="caps">CHROME</span> system made useful by the <span class="caps">CHROME</span> v8, css utililties, and other vital system components comprising a full <span class="caps">OS</span> as defined by the <span class="caps">W3C</span>.</p> <p><em>&ndash; <a href="https://orib.dev/interject.html">some weird internet&nbsp;person</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p>As advertised, the laptop could run ChromeOS apps, Android apps, and Linux apps via containers. By default I got a Debian container, but since I needed up-to-date software for development, I set up an Arch container instead. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chrome_OS_devices/Crostini">The process</a> itself was straightforward&nbsp;enough.</p> <p>Zoom for Android worked as expected, and to my surprise, Tailscale for Android managed to wrangle traffic correctly for programs running inside Crostini too! The only hiccup was that Magic <span class="caps">DNS</span> didn&rsquo;t work, so I needed to put the hostname-<span class="caps">IP</span> pairs into /etc/hosts manually. I also had to change the temp dir from /tmp to ~/tmp for <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> tools to work, because Crostini programs weren&rsquo;t allowed to exec files inside /tmp. Once I&rsquo;d worked out those kinks, I could open up a terminal and start working as if I were on one of my Arch PCs. Hell, even docker/docker-compose Just Worked™ inside the&nbsp;container.</p> <p>But then came the&nbsp;papercuts.</p> <p>The touchpad would randomly lag, as in, dragging still worked but there was a noticeable delay between my dragging and seeing the cursor actually moving. The problem would just go away as randomly as it&nbsp;happened.</p> <p>Back when I used an actual Linux machine, I was used to having 10 virtual desktops, numbered from 1 to 10, with Alt-n mapped to &ldquo;jump to desktop #n&rdquo;, and Windows-n mapped to &ldquo;move window to desktop #n&rdquo; (the <code>0</code> key maps to desktop #10, naturally). While ChromeOS has a &ldquo;workspaces&rdquo; feature, there&rsquo;s no way to navigate and juggle windows between them precisely and instantly. <em>Instantly</em> is an important keyword here: many tasks, while doable, suffered from gratuitous animations and tedious step-by-step navigation. This reminded me of when I tried to use a Macbook professionally: things kinda worked, but the experience would always be intrinsically&nbsp;worse.</p> <p>While Linux <span class="caps">GUI</span> programs were automagically put on the ChromeOS applications list as first class citizens, certain quality-of-life features didn&rsquo;t work. For example, on <span class="caps">KDE</span> I used to be able to drag a video streaming link from the browser onto <span class="caps">MPV</span>&rsquo;s taskbar icon <a href="/images/put.io_01_mpv.mp4">to play it</a>. This no longer worked on&nbsp;ChromeOS.</p> <p>So I jumped&nbsp;ship.</p> <h2 id="real-arch-linux-on-mrchromebox-uefi">Real Arch Linux on MrChromebox <span class="caps">UEFI</span><a class="headerlink" href="#real-arch-linux-on-mrchromebox-uefi" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>Installing <em>real</em> Linux on this device requires installing the MrChromebox custom <span class="caps">UEFI</span> firmware, which in turn requires disabling the firmware write protection. Fortunately, for this device all I needed to do was opening up the laptop and <a href="https://wiki.mrchromebox.tech/Firmware_Write_Protect#Hardware_Write_Protection">disconnecting the battery</a>:</p> <p><img alt="internals" src="/images/voxel_internals.jpg"></p> <p><img alt="battery-connector" src="/images/voxel_battery.jpg"></p> <p>If you need more detailed instructions, here&rsquo;s the <a href="/images/voxel_chromebook_cp7133w.pdf">official manual</a>.</p> <p>Then go <a href="https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript">here</a> for instructions on how to download and run the MrChromebox utility script. In my case, I also needed to enable developer mode to get access to the chrosh&nbsp;shell.</p> <p>After this I got a normal <span class="caps">UEFI</span> boot menu so I could pop in an Arch installer <span class="caps">USB</span> drive and carried out the installation as&nbsp;usual.</p> <p>I managed to install <span class="caps">KDE</span> plasma and everything worked except for audio: the usual &ldquo;default&rdquo; audio profile wouldn&rsquo;t show up, even after I installed the necessary packages: <code>sof-firmware</code> (sound firmware for recent Intel generations) and <code>alsa-ucm-conf</code> (so-called topologies for these newer devices). After some desperate googling I found <a href="https://github.com/eupnea-linux/audio-scripts">https://github.com/eupnea-linux/audio-scripts</a> which installed some missing configs lifted straight from ChromeOS upstream. Sure enough, the device showed&nbsp;up:</p> <p><img alt="default-profile-get" src="/images/voxel_audio_device.png" title></p> <p>And it would actually play sound&hellip; for a while until it crashes. I later found out that wired headphones and <span class="caps">HDMI</span> audio work just fine, so only using internal speakers is&nbsp;problematic.</p> <p>I collected logs and tried googling but nothing comes up that matches my case. Asking in the eupnea discord server yielded an uncertain&nbsp;response:</p> <blockquote> <p>looks like yet again intel broke&nbsp;something</p> </blockquote> <p>Oh, and the random touchpad delay issue was still there, so I&rsquo;m starting to think the touchpad hardware itself is&nbsp;problematic.</p> <p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at. I&rsquo;ll probably gather more logs and submit an issue to the <span class="caps">SOF</span> project. For now, consider this a warning: the laptop as of now is probably not worth buying. Hell, in Vietnam you can get a second hand X1 Carbon 6th gen with an i7-8650U and <span class="caps">16GB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span> for $460 right now from <a href="https://chotot.com">https://chotot.com</a>; that&rsquo;s a guaranteed best-in-class keyboard, decent screen and Linux compatibility, at just a slight decrease in&nbsp;performance.</p> <p>But hey, I would have never known any of this if I hadn&rsquo;t tried,&nbsp;right?</p> <h2 id="aside-chromebook-keyboard-quirks-on-kde">Aside: Chromebook keyboard quirks on <span class="caps">KDE</span><a class="headerlink" href="#aside-chromebook-keyboard-quirks-on-kde" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>The most glaring issue is the absence of the <code>windows</code> key (aka <code>super</code>, <code>hyper</code>, or <code>meta</code>). It&rsquo;s not a huge problem for me: I always make <code>capslock</code> act as a <code>ctrl</code> key, so I can turn the original <code>ctrl</code> into <code>windows</code> instead:</p> <p><img alt="changed-modifier-keys" src="/images/voxel_keys_mod.jpg"></p> <p>Another problem is that the F1-12 keys are not usable: they are <a href="https://github.com/MrChromebox/firmware/issues/349">mapped to function keys</a> in MrChromebox <span class="caps">UEFI</span> firmware, and there&rsquo;s no modifier to use them as F-keys either. That means no F11 to toggle fullscreen, no Alt-F4, no F9 to toggle drop-down terminal, etc. Fortunately such global shortcuts can be configured trivially from <span class="caps">KDE</span>&rsquo;s system preferences. On the other hand, application-specific features that are hardwired to use F-keys are simply unreachable: <code>htop</code> is one such&nbsp;example.</p> <p><img alt="htop-fkeys-unusable" src="/images/voxel_keys_f.png"></p> </article> </div> <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2> <div id="disqus_thread"> <button id="showCommentBtn">Show comments via Disqus</button> <noscript><br>(enable JavaScript first though)</noscript> </div> <script type="text/javascript">
