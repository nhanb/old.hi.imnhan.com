Said petition was apparently started by some Ms. Trần Ngọc Tuệ Mẫn - Student Council&rsquo;s vice president. Well&hellip; yay for free speech, I guess? Anyway, my name was really among the signers&nbsp;list:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/rmitsc_02_names.png"></p> <p>How did this happen? Well, turns out <strong>iPetition does not require email confirmation upon signing</strong>, so anyone can effectively enter any email and name they want and the stupid website will happily accept that as an absolutely definitely most positively legit supporter of your cause. Cool&nbsp;huh?</p> <p>Upon further inspection, almost all of the signer names are in one same format: the one that <span class="caps">RMIT</span> uses for its student names. So apparently a very motivated supporter of Ms. Mẫn&rsquo;s&hellip; interesting campaign has been helpful enough to go through <span class="caps">RMIT</span> students&rsquo; IDs and names and sign us up, without us even having to know what it&rsquo;s all about. Gee,&nbsp;thanks!</p> <h2 id="why-do-i-even-care">Why do I even care?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-i-even-care" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>I just don&rsquo;t like people using my name without my consent. More importantly, I have my reasons to disagree with the sentiments expressed in her petition description. Also I thought this could be a somewhat useful public service announcement, or a mildly entertaining daily wtf story. I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;know.</p> <p>Hell, let&rsquo;s throw in some of my own random thoughts to make this more like a blog&nbsp;post:</p> <ul> <li> <p>What&rsquo;s with these petition websites? Have people actually achieved anything using these? Even if a petition website does send confirmation emails, what&rsquo;s stopping me from using trash addresses? The signers&rsquo; email addresses are not displayed anyway so president@rmit.edu.vn won&rsquo;t be too different from lol0042@spam.me now, will it? If you&rsquo;re an official co-leader of something official who wants to do something official about it, maybe try a more, I don&rsquo;t know, official&nbsp;channel?</p> </li> <li> <p>The number of signers keep going up steadily, but slowly. Maybe our friendly neighborhood signerman is doing it all by hand instead of a script? If it&rsquo;s the former&hellip; let&rsquo;s say I do admire the dedication <strike>and abhor the absolute stupidity</strike>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it normal for a student council to be this full of&nbsp;drama?</p> </li> </ul> <p>That concludes my mostly pointless blog post. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll come up with something actually worth sharing soon. Until then, have an awesome&nbsp;weekend!</p> </article> </div> <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2> <div id="disqus_thread"> <button id="showCommentBtn">Show comments via Disqus</button> <noscript><br>(enable JavaScript first though)</noscript> </div> <script type="text/javascript">
