Now that I&rsquo;m not working full-time for anyone, there&rsquo;s no better time to Just Do&nbsp;It.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;ve done any research on <span class="caps">DIY</span> fightsticks, you&rsquo;ll know that the 2 best places to find guides are <a href="http://www.slagcoin.com/">Slagcoin</a> and <a href="http://forums.shoryuken.com/categories/tech-talk">Shoryuken Tech Talk</a>. I decided to follow the <a href="http://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/example2.html">basic design</a> on&nbsp;Slagcoin:</p> <p><img alt src="http://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/example2/simple1.jpg"></p> <h2 id="materials-and-tools">Materials and tools<a class="headerlink" href="#materials-and-tools" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>If you live in Hồ Chí Minh City like me, you can probably get everything you need from shops on Bạch Đằng Street. The only hard part for me was convincing a small wood shop to sell <span class="caps">MDF</span> panels cut to my specifications in small&nbsp;quantity:</p> <ul> <li>4 pieces x 30cm x 20cm x 1cm&nbsp;*</li> <li>2 pieces x 20cm x 4cm x&nbsp;2cm</li> <li>2 pieces x 20cm x 7cm x&nbsp;2cm</li> <li>1 piece x 26cm x 4cm x&nbsp;2cm</li> <li>4 pieces x 34cm x 7cm x 2cm&nbsp;*</li> </ul> <p>All that set me back 120,000 <span class="caps">VND</span>. The cost was mostly for cutting labor instead of actual material. The items with asterisks (*) are those I bought in abundance to make room for drilling&nbsp;errors.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_01_mdf.jpg"></p> <p>The top panel would be layered with 1 <span class="caps">MDF</span> and 2 plexiglass pieces (mad illustrating skillz, I&nbsp;know):</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_02_top_plan.jpg"></p> <p>The bottom would simply be 1 <span class="caps">MDF</span> and 1 plexiglass so I could also insert bottom&nbsp;artwork.</p> <p>Since I had zero woodworking experience, I joined the <span class="caps">MDF</span> pieces with simple butt joints and good old wood glue. You&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s a significant gap on one corner - turns out the shop wasn&rsquo;t too accurate with their cutting. It&rsquo;s not shown here but eventually I had to saw a longer <span class="caps">MDF</span> piece to replace&nbsp;it.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_03_glue.jpg"></p> <p>I already had a hand drill laying around so all it took was buying a couple of hole saws - 24mm and 30mm in diameter respectively. The bigger one was used for drilling main button holes while the other was for joystick hole and smaller front side&nbsp;buttons.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_04_hole_saw.jpg"></p> <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t buy</strong> hole saws like the one below - you will not be able to drill through thick panels (like the 20mm thick one I&nbsp;bought):</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_05_nope_saw.jpg"></p> <p>As for the actual parts, I ordered the joystick and buttons from <a href="https://www.akishop.jp/">Akishop</a>. It ships from Japan so the shipping cost to Vietnam is much more reasonable than if I buy from the <span class="caps">US</span>. I also bought a <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Zero-Delay-USB-Encoder-to-PC-Joystick-For-Arcade-DIY-KIT-Sanwa-Parts-MAME-/191558265304?hash=item2c99c329d8#shpCntId">Zero Delay <span class="caps">PCB</span> kit</a> from ebay. This one even offers free shipping since it&rsquo;s from China. This kit offers easy solder-free wires too so it saved me from a lot of trouble (I still can&rsquo;t find where to quick-disconnect terminals to this date). I connected everything to my <span class="caps">PC</span> to test if things worked as&nbsp;expected:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_26_electronics.jpg"></p> <p>Quick note: the popular wisdom is to buy screw-in buttons for thick panels and scap-in for thin ones. However, as my panel is <em>way</em> too thick even for screw-ins, snap-ins are actually the better choice: you just need to put the buttons in normally - the 2 sides of the button will push against the hole and keep it there fairly firmly. I never had a problem with my previous stick which was build this&nbsp;way.</p> <h2 id="actually-making-it">Actually making it<a class="headerlink" href="#actually-making-it" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>I drilled holes in the front side: first using the 30mm bit to drill halfway, then went all the way with the 24mm bit. This allows a small button to be placed deep into the case, avoiding accidentally button&nbsp;presses.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_06_front_holes.jpg"></p> <p>Then I glued the case body together. I didn&rsquo;t have big clamps laying around so I had to make do with an elastic string. It worked terribly&nbsp;though.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_07_glue_body.jpg"></p> <p>Note that the bottom panel was just there to keep the whole thing in shape. I took it out&nbsp;later:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_08_glue_body2.jpg"></p> <p>See the gap in the top left corner? That&rsquo;s the gap I was talking about earlier. Good thing I had a spare piece laying around, so I sawed it to the correct length to use as a&nbsp;replacement:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_09_saw_side.jpg"></p> <p>Now everything fitted together but there was some excess on one long side. Much sanding&nbsp;awaits!</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_10_excess.jpg"></p> <p>Initial sanding effort with 140 grit&nbsp;sandpaper:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_11_sanded.jpg"></p> <p>By the way, I recommend using a sanding block. It helps you apply more pressure evenly. I simply wrapped my sandpaper around a spare piece of <span class="caps">MDF</span>:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_12_sanding_block.jpg"></p> <p>Now on to the inner sides. These would support the top and bottom panels. I used a long piece of scrap plexiglass to apply pressure instead of a clamp. This time I put one 10mm-thick wood panel and one 3mm-thick plexiglass panel under it to make sure the inner supports are glued at the correct&nbsp;position.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_13_inner_support.jpg"></p> <p>With all 3 inner sides&nbsp;glued:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_14_inner_support2.jpg"></p> <p>Now you must be wondering why I had 2 inner pieces on the left side. I originally wanted to save some space and weight by sawing those into shorter support bits instead of long whole pieces that covered the full length. After sawing the first piece I decided that it wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort anyway so&hellip; there you have&nbsp;it.</p> <p>Here comes the next challenge: putting paint on the <span class="caps">MDF</span>. There is an <a href="http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/67501/how-to-paint-mdf-to-a-mirror-finish-worklog">extremely elaborate method</a> explained on Shoryuken Tech Talk that helps you achieve a mirror-like glossy finish. Of course I don&rsquo;t have the tools and patience to follow all that, but I followed the first few steps (cover edges with non-absorbent material, sand and spray paint multiple times) to achieve an acceptably smooth&nbsp;finish.</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s the first step: cover edges with non-absorbent material. The tutorial suggested using spackling, which I have no idea how to obtain from here. I settled with something Vietnamese people &ldquo;matic&rdquo; (mastic, perhaps?) which my friends said was to be used for the same purpose. The thing was yellow-ish and much more runny than spackling. It was also difficult as hell to work with: the moment it&rsquo;s spread on the <span class="caps">MDF</span> edge, it starts drying, at which point you can&rsquo;t touch it again unless you want an ugly grungy finish (is that even a&nbsp;word?):</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_15_mastic.jpg"></p> <p>I waited for the yellow thing to dry, then sanded it again. After a first few coats with glossy black spray paint, things didn&rsquo;t look too&nbsp;sexy:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_16_first_coat.jpg"></p> <p>It did get better with sanding (1200 grit) and more coats though. But then I made the most stupid decision: glueing the top panel on before&nbsp;drilling:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_17_top_panel.jpg"></p> <p>Now why was this bad? Because now I would be forced to drill top panel holes <em>with</em> the whole body attached, which will expose the whole thing to sawdust, which was generally <span class="caps">PITA</span> to clean up - the top panel made it a closed shape with corners and spaces all over the place. Also, if I screwed up the top <span class="caps">MDF</span> panel (which I eventually kinda did), the whole thing would be&nbsp;ruined.</p> <p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, I did paint it too. The paint layer would later make disgusting drill&nbsp;holes:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_18_joystick_hole.jpg"></p> <p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Here&rsquo;s how the case looked after a few more black coats and one clear coat (also put buttons in there to see how they&nbsp;fit):</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_19_finished_coat.jpg"></p> <p>I did drill an extra button hole because I realized I&rsquo;d need the &ldquo;Playstation&rdquo; button too if I want to use a <span class="caps">PS4</span> controller <span class="caps">PCB</span> later (which I plan to do). Unfortunately I only ordered 2 small buttons from Akishop so I had to use a green Chinese button I had laying&nbsp;around.</p> <p>Now here comes the hard part: drilling the top panel. As mentioned earlier, the top panel would be&nbsp;3-layer:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_02_top_plan.jpg"></p> <p>I placed all 3 pieces onto the case, but with the 4mm plexiglass on top (in the plan it&rsquo;s supposed to be in the middle - I&rsquo;ll explain later). Then I printed the Blast City button layout found on Slagcoin and taped it onto the whole&nbsp;thing:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_20_top_layout.jpg"></p> <p>Notice the extra two holes I drew above and below the joystick hole. Those are for screw holes for mounting the joystick. This is why I put the 4mm piece on top: I was going to drill these two holes on the 4mm piece only to leave room for screw heads. This way I didn&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;route&rdquo; the extra 2 holes on my <span class="caps">MDF</span> piece like the original plan (I was afraid the 10mm <span class="caps">MDF</span> thickness was already too&nbsp;thin).</p> <p>After drilling the necessary holes, I removed the plexiglass pieces and drilled the aformentioned 2 joystick mounting holes into to <span class="caps">MDF</span>, then I placed the joystick mounting plate onto the surface to plot the rectangular part that needed to be cut&nbsp;off:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_21_joystick_square.jpg"></p> <p>Since I don&rsquo;t have any power tool, I used my handy hand drill with the circular hole saw to gradually drill out the&nbsp;shape:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_22_joystick_drills.jpg"></p> <p>After much sanding and&nbsp;cleaning:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_18_joystick_hole.jpg"></p> <p>See the glorious tears? That&rsquo;s what premature painting does to you. Friends don&rsquo;t let friends paint&nbsp;prematurely!</p> <p>Anyway, I also drilled 3 hole on the bottom to install the bottom pieces (1 <span class="caps">MDF</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> 1 plexiglass). I also printed a quick picture as a placeholder artwork to see how it would&nbsp;look:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_23_bottom.jpg"></p> <p>As I was excited to finish the putting the top panel together, I hit a wall: because I couldn&rsquo;t possibly drill perfectly perpendicular screw holes, they could not property&nbsp;attach:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_25_loose_screw.jpg"></p> <p>Also, thanks to the switching positions between the two plexiglass pieces, the button holes didn&rsquo;t align anymore. I had to waste a buttload of time sanding the lower piece&rsquo;s holes to make them&nbsp;bigger.</p> <p>But that&rsquo;s not even the worst issue: because the screw holes were not aligned, once I screwed all four corners, the top plexiglass piece flexed, creating a blatantly noticeable&nbsp;gap:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_24_gap.jpg"></p> <h2 id="um-thats-it-for-now">Um&hellip; that&rsquo;s it (for now).<a class="headerlink" href="#um-thats-it-for-now" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2> <p>That&rsquo;s all of my progress so far. I&rsquo;m visiting my <a href="http://fablabsaigon.org/">local Fablab</a>, which is advertised to have <span class="caps">CNC</span> machines and laser cutters so I&rsquo;ll probably have a chance to produce more accurate panels. Hell, I may even redo the whole thing using machine-cut pieces for absolute accuracy and save myself from a world of&nbsp;pain.</p> <p>I took a lot of photos as I went, so if you want to see more photos of my progress, just check out my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nhanb/albums/72157661059385592">flickr album</a>.</p> <p>Till next&nbsp;time!</p> </article> </div> <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2> <div id="disqus_thread"> <button id="showCommentBtn">Show comments via Disqus</button> <noscript><br>(enable JavaScript first though)</noscript> </div> <script type="text/javascript">
