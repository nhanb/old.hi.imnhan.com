This is the source code for https://hi.imnhan.com using
[Pelican](http://github.com/getpelican/pelican)

# Dev environment

This repo targets Pelican 3.7 on python3. Initial setup on Arch Linux with
`pyenv-virtualenv` and `poetry` looks something like this:

```sh
pyenv install 3.7.4
pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 imnhan.com
pyenv activate imnhan.com
poetry install
```

Then use:

- `make devserver` / `make stopserver` for local dev at port 8000
- `make github` to publish to hi.imnhan.com

Alternatively, if you find the `make dev/stopserver` workflow clumsy, manually run `pelican -r` and
simple python http server to keep everything in the foreground:

```sh
pelican -r content  # in 1 terminal
cd output && python3 -m http.server 8000  # in another terminal
```
