Title: About
Thumb: images/keyboard-warrior.jpg

Hi, I'm Nhân. I make web<strike>shit</strike>stuff for a living.

![literally me](/images/keyboard-warrior.jpg)

My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much information after a couple of
months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover.
On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here too, but hopefully
those will be rare.

This blog is generated using [Pelican][1] and hosted on Github Pages.
Its source code can be found on my [github repo][2].

Think its font looks ugly? Customize it yourself! No really, this site is
configured to use your browser's designated `sans-serif` font, which you can
customize. Here's a [guide for Chrome][4].

I make a point not to include 3rd-party javascript on the page, with the
exception of [Disqus][3], which is not loaded by default - you'll need to
explicitly click on the "show comments" button below each post if you want to
view or write comments. I think that's a reasonable compromise.
